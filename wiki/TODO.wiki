== game import / scraping ==
=== general ===
 * upper() before game match?
 * handling of sequels and alternate titles

--> only use Alternate title if ratio < fuzzyFactor

--> search all alternate titles for best ratio

error in current version:

Alien Breed I:

23:09:23 T:7952 M:971927552  NOTICE: RCB_INFO: Comparing "Alien Breed I" and "Alien Breed II: The Horror Continues". Sequel numbers don't match. Result will be skipped

23:09:23 T:7952 M:971927552  NOTICE: RCB_INFO: "Alien Breed II: The Horror Continues" seems to be an alternate title of "Alien Breed I". Use it as result.


 * check special chars in pathes
 * Giantbomb API: check type of image/platform
	-> Result contains Releases
		-> loop releases and check for correct platform
		-> use release date and image of this release
 * mame support
 * check if import desc file with %GAME% still works in current version
 * add replace options as global option
 * stop searching when all games are found
 * db structure: extra properties for outline und plot (atm only description)
 * easy to use option to rescrape missing games
 * get back more than one URL in 1 Result? (e.g. BackCover, FrontCover, ...)
 * ,-separated list in scraper (e.g. more than genre on mobygames are ignored)
 * foldernamefromCRC (implementation looks strange)
 * new option: build crc from complete zip or first entry
 * backup mygames.db before update
 * new db field %RATING%
 * file browser mode
 * more Disk indicators for multi rom scenario (Disk %I)
 * config file per game
 * delete missing games from db
