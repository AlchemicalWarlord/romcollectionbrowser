This TODO list / roadmap is a working document. It will change quite frequently as I am always adding, removing or reordering issues that I want to work on for the next release. If you made a request or reported an issue that you don't find on the list please remind me because chances are that I just forgot to add it.


= next release =
== General ==
  * Export game database (nfo files) - Some of the nfo files exported don't have the Plot information even for the games that display it correctly in RCB.

== Import games ==
  * change name of scraped game (rescrape or interactive)
  * set "Always rescan games" automatically if in Rescrape mode
  * NFO files don't update when rescraping games. - Add option to overwrite
  * RCB "forgets" the Consoles filter after import or rescrape some game
  * bug: # in rom filename causes errors
  * import games with multiple . or - causes errors (like "WCW vs. NWO - world tour") --> "." interpreted as separator
  * replace smb:// when searching for roms and artwork
  * encoding: Pokémon (only Eden?)
  * Media or rom path with special characters (encoding issues)

== Browse games ==  
  * save filter settings not always working
  
== Launch games ==
  * move script files to userdata folder
  * add option if XBMC should go into windowed mode
  * check windowed mode with popen
  * add launch settings to addon settings. add option to overwrite settings per rom collection
  * integrate libretro (xbmc.executebuiltin('PlayMedia(%s)' %roms[0]))
  * pylzma for python 2.6 (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylzma/)
  * try to use "at" to restart XBMC: http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=134913 (Linux only?)
  
= one of next releases =
== Import games ==
  * update thegamesdb scraper
    * download publisher and developer artwork from thegamesdb.net
    * youtube link in thegamesdb scraper
  * add filename matching (instead of crc) to offline scraper
  * Could not create file: 'C:\Program Files\ROM project\ROMS\Sega Genesis\Artwork\boxfront\Triple Play 96 (F) [b1].jpg'. Error message: '[Errno socket error] timed out'
  * Still missing the possibility to define "Rom File Mask" as *.tzx.zip or *.tap.zip
  * It sounds like the best would be to have the collection name and the name sent to the scrapper be different settings. That way, I could have a "supermodel3" collection, but scrap the roms as "mame" roms.

== Browse games ==
  * remap home button
  * As speed has been such a large issue for me, I miss a feature to interrupt a collection load. Say I accidentally click on MAME with favourites de-selected for example - that mistake will cost quite a bit of time. 
  * add option to allow media to keep playing.

== Launch games ==
  * The other problem is, that every disc shows up as _disk in the selector.
  * use Popen for pre and post launch commands
  * add options to use vbscript on windows (Explorer hack issues)  
  * add option to use json api instead of kill command  
	Linux
	wget -q -O/dev/null --header='Content-Type: application/json' --post-data='{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "Application.Quit", "id":"1"}' http://localhost/jsonrpc  
  
	Windows (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/wget/)
	"%PROGRAMFILES%\GnuWin32\bin\wget.exe" -q --header="Content-Type: application/json" --post-data="{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"method\": \"Application.Quit\", \"id\":\"1\"}" http://localhost/jsonrpc
  * add option to autostart RCB everytime in RCB service
  * Is there anyway to point RCB to the rom path instead of the rom file?
  
= Known bugs/issues =
== General ==
  * start RCB twice: atomic init routine?
  * XBMC frequently locks up on shutdown
  * check for errors in scrapeonstartup
	--> error handling when there are errors in config?
  * db in memory: id = null?

== Import games ==
  * resolved path from rom folder name: C:\Users\Mic\Downloads\Arcade\Data\MAME\My_Art\boxfront\C:\Users\Mic\Downloads\Arcade\Data\MAME\My_Roms
  * resolved path from rom folder name: smb://terastation/media/Roms/SNES/Boxart/boxfront/smb://terastation/media/Roms/SNES
  
== Browse games ==
  * autoplay video in Info window not reliable
  * video playback in non-Confluence skins
  * filters lost after game (2nd?) import
  * when you have videos selected for games, whilst browsing the video will still play if the next game does not have a video.

    * no import of images to database. just check the directories at runtime. Performance tests
    * rom collection base path and all files relative to that

    * manual scraping games (update properties and images) - already work in progress since 1.0.2
    * enter search text when scraping for single games - already work in progress since 1.0.2

    * more than 1 URL in 1 Result (e.g. BackCover, FrontCover, ...) is not supported atm
    * ,-separated list in scraper
    * scraping option: use subtitle search
    * only search for subtitles with : and - (and maybe only when sequel number)
    * support a.k.a. titles from mobygames
  * new option: crc from complete zip or first entry
  * option to hide progress bar in background mode
  * support 2 or more developers

  * ask before cancel

  * option to create sub collections: best sports games, ...
  * option to keep rom name as game name (better support for extra info in rom names (USA), (Beta))
  * support selection of similar named versions of games (select version to import by user or mask)
	Final Fantasy III (USA) (Beta).zip
	Final Fantasy III (USA) (Rev 1).zip
	Final Fantasy III (USA).zip
  * option to flatten downloaded artwork files (1 file per different game version)
  * two-step import: 1. local data, 2. online data
  * Another thing that could be useful in the next versions of RCB its de capacity of search for artwork in subdirectories.
  * support same games with slightly different names (e.g. region in name)
  * When using network share, it's saving the path as //SERVER/location and not smb://SERVER/location for artwork ... this causes problems when playing videos. It will load the first video, but none after that. It also is saving the last directory in the path with a backslash '\' instead of a forward slash, but after testing this is only a cosmetic issue and doesn't cause any playback/viewing issues from what i can tell

  * view images fullscreen by pressing enter upon the art or similar
  * option to hide game infos in main view (show up on pressing I or similar)
  * support for game name artwork
  * parental support: It might work as follows, after to trigger the option "ParentalRating" a box text is displayed for entering the password if the password is entered correctly, all games are displayed on RCB.
  * Would it be possible to load and display only 100 randoms ROM at launch ? Or to wait the selection of a query before loading a list ?
  * Container.NextSortMethod
  * Add option to play a video only once, when sitting on the selection screen it just keeps looping the videos and it's driving me crazy heh.
