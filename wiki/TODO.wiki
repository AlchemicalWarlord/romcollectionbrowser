This TODO list / roadmap is a working document. It will change quite frequently as I am always adding, removing or reordering issues that I want to work on for the next release. If you made a request or reported an issue that you don't find on the list please remind me because chances are that I just forgot to add it.

== Import Games ==
  * remove thevideogamedb scraper: remove from config.xml on startup
  * When I added the games the first time, I didn't add the videos. When I added the videos later on, they wouldn't show up despite being found.
The only way to get them to show was to delete the romcollection and reimport from scratch; rescanning the games did not work.
