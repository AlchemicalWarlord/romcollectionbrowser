This TODO list / roadmap is a working document. It will change quite frequently as I am always adding, removing or reordering issues that I want to work on for the next release. If you made a request or reported an issue that you don't find on the list please remind me because chances are that I just forgot to add it.


= next relase =
== Import games ==
  * RCB "forgets" the Consoles filter after import or rescrape some game
    * restore list after import failed or canceled

= (one of) next release(s) =
== General ==
  * Export game database (nfo files) - Some of the nfo files exported don't have the Plot information even for the games that display it correctly in RCB.
  * start RCB twice: atomic init routine?

  * NFO files don't update when rescraping games. - Add option to overwrite
  * bug: # in rom filename causes errors
  * import games with multiple . or - causes errors (like "WCW vs. NWO - world tour") --> "." interpreted as separator
  * replace smb:// when searching for roms and artwork
    * create local link in userdata folder?
  * resolved path from rom folder name: C:\Users\Mic\Downloads\Arcade\Data\MAME\My_Art\boxfront\C:\Users\Mic\Downloads\Arcade\Data\MAME\My_Roms
  * resolved path from rom folder name: smb://terastation/media/Roms/SNES/Boxart/boxfront/smb://terastation/media/Roms/SNES
  
== Browse Games ==
  * improve loading time or add options to load smaller amount of games
    * new caching option: load list in background (maybe remove cacheitem and next)

  * Edit offline scrapers:

    * store exact release dates (not only release year)
    * region support
      * add region flag per rom collection (also ALL option)
      * determine region per game (e.g. [US] or (US) in name)
      * store different releases in 1 zip or 7z file (look inside file and mark game as available?)
  * build game groups (releases and sequels)
    * collect minimal game data for missing games in game group (even if certain roms are not present)
  * add staff (e.g. developer, artists, ... from mobygames)
  * mark game as completed
  * mark game as broken (in db + .broken in filename)
  * lastplayed

=== Import games ===
  * add filename matching (instead of crc) to offline scraper
  * Could not create file: 'C:\Program Files\ROM project\ROMS\Sega Genesis\Artwork\boxfront\Triple Play 96 (F) [b1].jpg'. Error message: '[Errno socket error] timed out'
  * Still missing the possibility to define "Rom File Mask" as *.tzx.zip or *.tap.zip
  * It sounds like the best would be to have the collection name and the name sent to the scrapper be different settings. That way, I could have a "supermodel3" collection, but scrap the roms as "mame" roms.
  * apple makes a shadow folder called '.AppleDouble' and makes an identically named file entry in that directory for every file in the real directory.
  * refactor dbupdate (requires data model changes)
    * no import of images to database. just check the directories at runtime. Performance tests
    * rom collection base path and all files relative to that
    * check preconditions before game import

    * support a.k.a. titles from mobygames
  * new option: crc from complete zip or first entry
  * option to hide progress bar in background mode
