= How to add standalone PC games =

== Preparation ==
To add standalone games in RCB you will need one single folder that contains shortcuts to all of your games. Just create a shortcut like you would do to add a shortcut to your desktop. Copy this shortcut file to a separate foler. In this example it is "E:\Games\Standalone". In this example I just used one shortcut for one game. Of course you can use many shortcuts for many games.

== Scenario ==
Usually you will use online scraping scenario to grab game info and artwork online.

== Platform ==
Use Linux, Macintosh or Windows as System. In this example I use Windows.

== Rom path ==
Select the path to your shortcut folder.

== File mask ==
On Windows use `*.lnk` as file mask (or whatever the extension of your shortcuts may be).

== Artwork ==
Select the path where you want to store your artwork (or where your artwork is already stored). This folder can be empty.

In online scraping scenario RCB will create the following sub folders (one for every different artwork type):

boxfront, boxback, cartridge, screenshot and fanart

If you don't want to add another Rom Collection, just select No.

== Import games ==
In this example I just do an import of the new added Windows games.

== Enjoy ==
The result may look like this (it may look better if you add more than one game)
