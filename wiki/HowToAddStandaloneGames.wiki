= How to add standalone PC games =
Support for standalone games works as follows:
  * create a folder with shortcuts to your standalone games (e.g. lnk-files)
  * in RCB start the Add Rom Collection Wizard
  * use Linux, Macintosh or Windows as System
  * select the path to your shortcuts as rom path
  * use *.lnk as file mask (or whatever the extension of your shortcuts may be)
  * RCB will automatically detect that it should launch PC games and won't ask for emulator configuration
