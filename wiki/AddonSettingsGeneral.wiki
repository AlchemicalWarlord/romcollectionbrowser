You can access RCBs global settings via the context menu in addons / scripts list in XBMC (press C on the keyboard).

= RCB skin =
Atm there are three different skins available for RCB: Confluence, Night and Simplicity (thanks to mcborzu and igotdvds for the last two). Regardless what skin you are using as default skin in XBMC you can choose to run RCB with any of these three skins. To use these skins you don't have to do anything else on your side than just select the skin in RCB settings. But by default you won't see the skin specific fonts in RCB. XBMC will use the fonts of your default skin if it can't find the specific fonts. If you want to use the skin specific fonts just check the section below.

== Optional steps to enable skin specific fonts ==
To get the skin specific fonts working in different default skins you have to do the following:
1. go to "RCB install dir\resources\skins\fonts" and copy the *.ttf files to your default skins fonts dir
2. copy the content of the file "RCB install dir\resources\skins\Font.xml" to the "720p\Font.xml" file of your default skin (details are explained in the file itself)
3. restart XBMC

Unfortunately, you have to redo these steps every time you update your default skin (if you update it via XBMC addon manager).

Where to find the default skin files:
Confluence: "XBMC install dir/addons/skin.confluence"
All other: "XBMC userdata/addons/skin.xxx"

= Log Level =
Set RCBs log level. Allowed values: ERROR, WARNING, INFO or DEBUG

= Caching Option =
Controls RCBs caching behaviour. Allowed values: CACHEALL, CACHEITEM, CACHEITEMANDNEXT.

CACHEALL: loads and caches all media files at startup. Best for large rom collections on fast PCs with enough RAM. Scrolling down the game list may be a bit slower with this setting because XBMC renders all images that it passes by.

CACHEITEM: loads only the media files shown in the game list when the game list is built. All extra info will be loaded when a game is selected.
Best for slow PCs with little RAM or xbox. Fast list scrolling is possible because XBMC does not render all images. Game list flickers while browsing because every game info has to be loaded when a game is selected.

CACHEITEMANDNEXT: same as CACHEITEM. This will also load the media files and description for the item before and after the selected one. This will reduce flickering while browsing the game list (if not browsing too fast).

= Save Viewstate On Exit =
If set to "True" RCB will save the current view state (selected filter criteria and focused control) and restores it when you launch it the next time. This option will be used when exiting RCB.

= Save Viewstate On Launch Emu =
If set to "True" RCB will save the current view state (selected filter criteria and focused control) and restores it when you launch it the next time. This option will be used when launching an emulator in "solo" mode.
