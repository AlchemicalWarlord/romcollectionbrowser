You can access RCBs global settings via the context menu in addons / scripts list in XBMC (press C on the keyboard).

= Browse Games =

== Show Filter All Consoles ==
Actually there are five filter lists to browse your rom files. Every list has an entry "All" per default. If you have a large rom collection and you try to load all your roms unfiltered this can take some time. You can set this property to "False" to remove the entry "All" from the Console filter list.

== Show Filter All Genres ==
You can set this property to "False" to remove the entry "All" from the Genre filter list.

== Show Filter All Years ==
You can set this property to "False" to remove the entry "All" from the Year filter list.

== Show Filter All Publishers ==
You can set this property to "False" to remove the entry "All" from the Publishers filter list.

== Show Filter All Chars ==
You can set this property to "False" to remove the entry "All" from the A-Z filter list.

== Prevent Unfiltered Search ==
This will prevent RCB from showing ALL your roms without any filter criteria. If you play around with yor filter criterias it may happen that you start an unfiltered search letting RCB search for all your roms. With a large rom collection on a slow machine this will take a lot of time. You should set this option to "True" in this case.
