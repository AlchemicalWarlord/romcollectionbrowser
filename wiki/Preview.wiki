= Introduction =
With this XBMC script you can browse and launch emulator roms and standalone games (Windows, Linux and Xbox). It will scrape game info and artwork from various online sources or imports local available game descriptions, images and videos. RCB will parse simple text files with additional game information like genre, publisher, developer, release year, etc. To support different description file formats and scrapable web sites you can configure the behaviour of the parser with xml configuration files.

It is a good idea to start with the test scenario. It will only take two minutes to set up and you will see how RCB can look like and get a first impression how things can be configured. Most options should be self explanating. If you have any problems or questions check this wiki or ask in the XBMC forum thread.

Before you can launch games with RCB you have to download, install and configure one or more emulators. Find out how to launch your emulator via command line. You will need this information to launch the emulator with RCB.

= Installation =
Note: RCBs configuration file "config.xml" will be stored in your XBMC userdata folder. You will find this folder in your user environment ([http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Special_protocol#Platform_Specific_Default_Mappings Look here for special://home]). If you installed XBMC in portable mode you will find it in the XBMC installation directory. RCBs configuration is stored in "script_data/script.games.rom.collection.browser" (Camelot) or "addon_data/script.games.rom.collection.browser" (Dharma).

== Camelot ==
  * Download [http://romcollectionbrowser.googlecode.com/files/script.games.rom.collection.browser-0.7.7.zip script.games.rom.collection.browser-0.7.7.zip]
  * Unzip it to your XBMC scripts folder

== Dharma ==
=== via Repo Browser ===
  * Go to XBMCs Addon Browser: System -> Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> XBMC.org Add-ons -> Program Add-ons --> Rom Collection Browser
  * Choose Install
=== via zip file ===
  * Download [http://romcollectionbrowser.googlecode.com/files/script.games.rom.collection.browser-0.7.7.zip script.games.rom.collection.browser-0.7.7.zip]
  * Go to XBMCs Addon Browser: System -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file

  
=== Known issues ===
==== The program doesn't load on “No module named pysqlite2” ====
Some distributions don't ship with prebuild pysqlite libraries. You have to get them on your own and copy them to your xbmc lib folder (e.g. /usr/lib/xbmc/addons/script.module.pysqlite). I made an extra package with these libraries if you don't want to build them yourself: http://romcollectionbrowser.googlecode.com/files/platform_libraries.zip.

= First use =
  * Start XBMC and launch RCB
  * If there is no file config.xml in your userdata folder, RCB will start a simple creation wizard. This will help you to create a config file with most common settings.
  * In most scenarios the wizard will fit all your needs. More advanced or special settings still must be done in the config file itself.
  
== Create a config file (with startup wizard) ==
  * First you have to choose a scenario: Online scraping or local data. In online scraping scenario RCB will scrape different web sites for game infos and artwork (boxfront, boxback, cartridge, screenshot and fanart). Local data scenario requires local available game descriptions, artwork or videos.
  * Repeat the following steps for every system you want to configure (you can also create just one system with the wizard and do the rest per copy/paste in the config file itself)
  * Choose a system. If you don't find your system in the list, select "Other" and type the name of your system. Note: Some scrapers won't work properly without a known system.
  * Select the path to the emulator for this system.
  * Enter the parameters for the emulator. Use "%ROM%" as placeholder if you need to pass the rom filename to the emulator.
  * Select the path to your rom files.
  * Enter one or more file masks (comma-separated). RCB will search the rom path and all sub folders for files that match the given filemask.
  * Online scraping scenario:
    * Select the path where you want to store your artwork (or where your artwork is already stored). Note: RCB scrapes and downloads 5 different artwork types. It needs to store all these files in different folders, so it tries to create sub folders below the given path: boxfront, boxback, cartridge, screenshot and fanart. If the user that runs xbmc does not have permission to create folders in this directory, please create these folders manually.
  * Local data scenario: 
    * Choose an artwork type.
    * Select the path to the artwork of this type.
    * Choose the type of description files. There may be large files with descriptions for all of your games or single description files for every game.
    * Select the path to your description files.
    * Select the path to the parse instruction for the given description file.
  
== XBMC Live users ==
If you use XBMC Live without an additional window manager you can use RCB only in non-solo mode (useEmuSolo=False). See [Preview#useEmuSolo useEmuSolo] for more details.

== Xbox users ==
Launching games on Xbox differs from launching games on a PC. You can launch .xbe-files directly from RCB if you set "%ROM%" as emulatorCmd and leave emulatorParams empty. If you want to launch an emulator and pass the rom file as an argument to the emu you have to use .cut-files. RCB can create this .cut-files on-the-fly for you. With using .cut-files you also have to set emulatorCmd to "%ROM%".

See [Preview#Launching_games Launching games] for details.

= Addon settings =
You can access RCBs global settings via the context menu in addons / scripts list in XBMC (press C on the keyboard).

== Log Level ==
Set RCBs log level. Allowed values: ERROR, WARNING, INFO or DEBUG

== Use Emulator solo ==
If set to "True" RCB will try to kill XBMC before starting the emulator. After exiting the emulator you will return to XBMC. If "False" the emulator will be launched while XBMC is running in the background.

This mechanism invokes a batch (Windows) or bash (Linux) file. Linux only: make sure the file "RCB install dir/applaunch.sh" is executable. If you have problems with launching the emulator or returning to XBMC please check the commands in the file "applaunch.bat" (Windows) or "applaunch.sh" (Linux). You must be able to execute the command that is used to launch XBMC.

When restarting XBMC RCB will try to create a file "autoexec.py" in XBMCs main script directory (Camelot) or in your userdata folder (Dharma). This will be used by XBMC to launch RCB automatically after restarting. If you already use an "autoexec.py" RCB will try to backup your original file and restores it after restarting. Make sure that the user that runs XBMC has write access to XBMCs main script directory (Camelot only).

== Escape Emulator Cmd ==
This will escape the rom file names passed to the emulatorCmd. Try to change this if you are running into problems with launching games.

== Caching Option ==
Controls RCBs caching behaviour. Allowed values: CACHEALL, CACHEITEM, CACHEITEMANDNEXT.

CACHEALL: loads and caches all media files at startup. Best for large rom collections on fast PCs with enough RAM. Scrolling down the game list may be a bit slower with this setting because XBMC renders all images that it passes by.

CACHEITEM: loads only the media files shown in the game list when the game list is built. All extra info will be loaded when a game is selected.
Best for slow PCs with little RAM or xbox. Fast list scrolling is possible because XBMC does not render all images. Game list flickers while browsing because every game info has to be loaded when a game is selected.

CACHEITEMANDNEXT: same as CACHEITEM. This will also load the media files and description for the item before and after the selected one. This will reduce flickering while browsing the game list (if not browsing too fast).

== Create local nfo file while scraping ==
Set this option to "True" if you want RCB to create nfo files while scraping. These nfo files contain all game meta information like name, genre, description, release year, etc. They will be saved next to the scanned rom files with a name romfile.nfo. Make sure that the user who runs xbmc has permission to create files in your rom directory.

These nfo files can be edited and reimported into RCBs database. This can be used to add or edit game properties or to save time when rebuilding your database.

== Don't import games without description ==
Set this to "True" if you want to skip all games that RCB can't find any description for. RCB will create a file "missingDesc.txt" while scraping. This file contains a list of all skipped games.

== Don't import games without artwork ==
Set this to "True" if you want to skip all games that RCB can't find any artwork for. RCB will create a file "missingArtwork.txt" while scraping. This file contains a list of all missing artwork types.

== Always rescan imported games ==
Before scraping game information, RCB checks if the current rom file is already imported to the database. RCB will skip scraping these games unless you set this option to "True".

== Show Filter All Consoles ==
Actually there are five filter lists to browse your rom files. Every list has an entry "All" per default. If you have a large rom collection and you try to load all your roms unfiltered this can take some time. You can set this property to "False" to remove the entry "All" from the Console filter list.

== Show Filter All Genres ==
You can set this property to "False" to remove the entry "All" from the Genre filter list.

== Show Filter All Years ==
You can set this property to "False" to remove the entry "All" from the Year filter list.

== Show Filter All Publishers ==
You can set this property to "False" to remove the entry "All" from the Publishers filter list.

== Show Filter All Chars ==
You can set this property to "False" to remove the entry "All" from the A-Z filter list.

== Prevent Unfiltered Search ==
This will prevent RCB from showing ALL your roms without any filter criteria. If you play around with yor filter criterias it may happen that you start an unfiltered search letting RCB search for all your roms. With a large rom collection on a slow machine this will take a lot of time. You should set this option to "True" in this case.

== Save Viewstate On Exit ==
If set to "True" RCB will save the current view state (selected filter criteria and focused control) and restores it when you launch it the next time. This option will be used when exiting RCB.

== Save Viewstate On Launch Emu ==
If set to "True" RCB will save the current view state (selected filter criteria and focused control) and restores it when you launch it the next time. This option will be used when launching an emulator in "solo" mode.


= Setup test scenario =
To show you how this script will work and how data should (could) be organized I also provide a zip file with testdata. This includes covers, game screenshots, game description files and sample configuration files for 7 Amiga and 8 SNES games. I also added 3 gameplay videos to show you how videos will look like in RCB. It only includes placeholder files for the roms (empty text files). This test scenario is not really meant to play the games, it should just show you how to configure this script.

  # Install RCB like described in chapter Installation
  # Download "Testdata 0.6.x.zip" (http://romcollectionbrowser.googlecode.com/files/Testdata%200.6.x.zip)
  # Unzip it somewhere
  # Go to the new Testdata folder
  # Edit "config_Windows.xml" or "config_Linux.xml": Replace every occurance of "PathToTestData" with the absolute path to your Testdata folder (e.g. "/home/user/Testdata 0.6.x" or "D:\Downloads\RCB\Testdata 0.6.x")
  # Rename "config_Windows.xml" or "config_Linux.xml" to "config.xml"
  # Copy "config.xml" to your userdata folder ("script_data/script.games.rom.collection.browser" (Camelot) or "addon_data/script.games.rom.collection.browser" (Dharma))
  # Start xbmc and launch RCB
  # RCB will notice that there is no database and asks you if you would like to import settings. Click "Yes".
  # If "Import Settings" was successful RCB will offer you to import games now. Click "Yes" to continue.

Now you should be able to browse the games by filter criteria and watch all information and artwork. 

If you want to launch roms with the test scenario you have to take these additional steps:
  # Go to your Testdata folder and replace the placeholder rom files with real ones (e.g. Testdata 0.6.x/Collection V1/roms/).
  # Edit the value of property "emulatorCmd". This command will be invoked when you launch a rom file. %ROM% will be replaced with the name of the rom file to be launched. If you have multiple rom files for one game %I% will be replaced with the (zero-based) index of the current file.   

  
= Usage =
== Navigation ==
Navigation should be self explanating. Move around with the arrow keys and see what happens. There are some filter controls at the top and some buttons at the bottom of the page that are hidden in the normal view. They will show up if they receive focus and hide if they lose it.

If the filter controls own the focus you can jump to the game list with "Enter" (or SELECT-Button on a remote).

In game list you can launch games with "Enter" or go to the details page with "I" (or INFO-Button on a remote).

To exit the script or to leave the details page just press "Esc" (or BACK-Button on a remote).

== Import Games ==
RCB will scan your rom folders and data folders and imports all game relevant data. To get this job done you have to tell it where to search and what to search for. Global settings (for all rom collections) can be changed via the Addons settings. Rom collection specific settings are stored in RCBs configuration file config.xml.

Every imported file will be associated with a game and a file type (boxfront, screenshot, fanart, gameplay video, ...). Only the path to the file is imported, not the file itself. If you delete or move the file after importing, RCB won't find it anymore.

RCB will also try to parse description files or scrapes web sites for your games during import. RCB ships with a set of preconfigured online scrapers (e.g. thevideogamedb.com, thegamesdb.net, giantbomb.com or mobygames.com). These scrapers can be invoked all together or combined with local description files. You can define the used scrapers and the ordering of scrapers in config.xml.

If you encounter any errors or miss some game infos after import, check XBMCs logfile. Search for any occurance of "RCB_ERROR" or "RCB_WARNING" to see what is missing. RCB will also create two text files ("missingDesc.txt" and "missingArtwork.txt") with information about missing data. You will find these files in RCBs userdata directory.

If you add new data to one of your rom collections you can use "Import Games" as often as you like. Every run will import new data and updates the data that is already stored in database.

Depending on your rom collections size and the number of used scrapers importing games can take some time.


= Configuration =
Configuration is done via xml files. There is one main configuration file "config.xml" that must be placed in your userdata folder ("script_data/script.games.rom.collection.browser" (Camelot) or "addon_data/script.games.rom.collection.browser" (Dharma)). If this file is not found at startup, RCB will start a creation wizard that helps you to create a simple config.xml with most common settings (See [Preview#First_use First use] for more information).

Global settings can be changed in the Addons settings (See [Preview#Addon_settings Addon settings] for more information).

There are three stages where RCB reads its settings: [Preview#Import_games_and_media Importing Games], [Preview#Browsing_and_displaying_games Browsing and Displaying Games] and [Preview#Launching_games Launching Games]. You only need to "Import Games" if you make changes to settings that address the "Importing Games" stage.

== How to read the Configuration section ==
There are a lot of configuration entries that are not shown in the example configurations or that don't occur in your config.xml (RCB will use the default values). All properties that are explained in the configuration section can be added as xml elements to the mentioned parent in your config.xml. 

This means if you read the description of property `descFilePerGame` and you see that it has the parent `RomCollection` you have to add a new xml element `<descFilePerGame>False</descFilePerGame>` inside the parent element `RomCollection`.

== Configuration File Format (config.xml) ==

The basic structure of RCBs config file looks like this:

{{{
<config>
	<RomCollections>
		<RomCollection>
			<!-- elements -->
		</RomCollection>
	</RomCollections>
	<FileTypes>
		<FileType>
			<!-- elements -->
		</FileType>
	</FileTypes>
	<ImagePlacing>
		<!-- elements -->
	</ImagePlacing>
	<Scrapers>
		<!-- elements -->
	</Scrapers>
</config>
}}}

Usually you should only get in contact with the `RomCollection` entries. If you have some special requirements and you know what you are doing you can of course change everything else.

Most settings have a default value. If you don't use a setting in config.xml, RCB will work with the default value.

== Import games and media ==
=== Basic configuration ===
A typical `RomCollection` entry (like it could be created in the online scraping scenario) will look like this:
{{{
<config>
  <RomCollections>
    <RomCollection id="1" name="SNES">
      <emulatorCmd>C:\Program Files\Emulatoren\zsnesw151\zsnesw.exe</emulatorCmd>
      <emulatorParams>-m "%ROM%"</emulatorParams>
      <romPath>F:\Emulatoren\data\Roms\SNES\*.zip</romPath>
      <mediaPath type="boxfront">F:\Emulatoren\data\Artwork\SNES\boxfront\%GAME%.*</mediaPath>
      <mediaPath type="boxback">F:\Emulatoren\data\Artwork\SNES\boxback\%GAME%.*</mediaPath>
      <mediaPath type="cartridge">F:\Emulatoren\data\Artwork\SNES\cartridge\%GAME%.*</mediaPath>
      <mediaPath type="screenshot">F:\Emulatoren\data\Artwork\SNES\screenshot\%GAME%.*</mediaPath>
      <mediaPath type="fanart">F:\Emulatoren\data\Artwork\SNES\fanart\%GAME%.*</mediaPath>
      <imagePlacing>gameinfobig</imagePlacing>
      <scraper name="thevideogamedb.com" />
      <scraper name="thegamesdb.net" replaceKeyString=" III, II" replaceValueString=" 3, 2" />
      <scraper name="giantbomb.com" replaceKeyString=" III, II" replaceValueString=" 3, 2" />
      <scraper name="mobygames.com" platform="15" replaceKeyString=" III, II" replaceValueString=" 3, 2" />
    </RomCollection>    
  </RomCollections>
  ...
</config>
}}}


==== Rom Collection ====
You need a `RomCollection` entry for every different Rom Collection. Different means: a different console, folder structure, description file format, ... Everything that can't be done with one configuration entry.

===== id =====
This id will be created if you use the config creation wizard. If you copy/paste a `RomCollection` make sure that ids are unique. Ids are also referenced in RCBs database `MyGames.db`. Don't change ids after you have done a game import!

===== name =====
This is only used to distinguish rom collections. Make sure that the name is unique. But you can change the name if you like.

===== romPath =====
The path to your rom files. This path should include wildcards and file extension (`*`.adf for example).

You may use different paths and file extensions (.zip and .smc for example) for one collection.

Examples:

/home/user/emu/SNES/Collection V3/roms/`*`.zip

/home/user/emu/SNES/Collection V3/roms/`*`.smc

===== emulatorCmd =====
emulatorCmd belongs to the stage "Launching games" and will be discussed later. See [Preview#Launching_games Launching games] for details. You also don't have to "Import Games" again if you change this setting.

===== emulatorParams =====
emulatorParams belongs to the stage "Launching games" and will be discussed later. See [Preview#Launching_games Launching games] for details. You also don't have to "Import Games" again if you change this setting.

===== mediaPath =====
The path to your image or video files. RCB will also use these paths to store artwork while scraping from online sources. There can be multiple `<mediaPath>` elements per `RomCollection`. Each element needs an attribute `type`. This type references the name of the configured `FileTypes`. All images or videos that match the given path will be imported and associated with the `FileType`. Types will also be used to configure the fileTypeFor...-elements in `ImagePlacing` (see section [Preview#dynamic_image_placing dynamic image placing] for more detalis).

You can use multiple `<mediaPath>` entries with the same type to import from different locations or to configure different file extensions.

You can use the following placeholders: %GAME%, %CONSOLE%, %PUBLISHER%, %DEVELOPER% (will be replaced with the according game property)

Configuration Example:

If you have a Game "Mygame" its rom file may be named "Mygame.adf" (adf = amiga game). All screenshots must be named "Mygame.jpg" (or png, gif, ...) OR they must reside in a folder that is called "Mygame". RCB will import all image files in this folder and associate it with the game "Mygame". Configuration of image or video paths can look like this:

"/home/user/emu/amiga/screens/%GAME%/`*`.png" (will import all png-files in folder "Mygame")

"/home/user/emu/amiga/%GAME%/screens/`*`.png" (will import all png-files in folder "Mygame/screens")

"/home/user/emu/amiga/screens/%GAME%.png" (will import the file "Mygame.png" in folder "screens")


===== scraper =====
With the scraper-elements in `RomCollection` you can control RCBs scraping behaviour. You can delete or reorder scrapers or add values that should be replaced in game names before scraping.

See section [Preview#how_to_improve_scrape_results How to improve scrape results] for more details.

===== imagePlacing =====
With the `imagePlacing` tag you can select one of the `imagePlacing` options that control which image types are shown in which image controls.

See section [Preview#dynamic_image_placing dynamic image placing] for more details.


==== File Type ====
With `FileTypes` you can define your own image or video categories. You can create a `FileType` for any new category that you like (e.g. action screenshots, boxart, highscore screenshots, gameplay videos, trailers, etc.). All imported images or videos will be associated with this `FileType` for later reference. If you create your config.xml with the startup wizard, RCB will create these tags for you.

===== id =====
Unique identifier. Don't change the id after you have imported games!

===== name =====
The name is referenced as type in `mediaPath` and fileTypeFor...-elements.

===== type =====
Must be "image" or "video".

===== parent =====
The parent that is associated with the image or video. Must be one of the following: game, console, developer, publisher, romcollection.
 

=== Add game description ===
In online scraping scenario game description will be added automatically (if available). If you want to use local game descriptions you will need description files (containing the description) and a parser configuration (tells RCB how to parse the description file format). The format of the parser configuration is explained in section [Preview#parserConfig.xml parserConfig.xml].

Local game description and parsers are also added as scrapers. See section [Preview#add_offline_scrapers Add offline scrapers] for more details.

You can download some (nearly) complete description files and a working parserConfig here: http://romcollectionbrowser.googlecode.com/files/gamedesc.zip. Actually it covers "NES", "SNES", "SEGA 32", "SEGA CD", "SEGA Genesis", "SEGA Game Gear", "SEGA Master System", "SEGA SG-1000" and "Gameboy". These descriptions all contain crc values, so you should not need to rename your roms to match the descriptions.

User [http://forum.xbmc.org/showpost.php?p=612640&postcount=580 spyvsspy has compiled] some more game descriptions (all included with working parserConfig and all using crc values): [http://jumbofiles.com/4bo7ue9f000b Mame], [http://jumbofiles.com/s6i1kve2n18t C64], [http://jumbofiles.com/kmcvpukjayn2 Amiga small], [http://jumbofiles.com/1ija5cepffeh Amiga big (may be problematic to parse because of its size)],[http://jumbofiles.com/ro4bfpiajjp5 ColecoVision]


==== Scraper ====
===== descFilePath =====
The path to the game description files. These files will be used to obtain additional information  about a game like genre, plot, publisher etc. Depending on the "`descFilePerGame`"-Parameter this should be the absolute path to one description file or a path using the %GAME%-placeholder. There can only be one descFilePath per `RomCollection`.

Examples:

"/home/user/roms/%GAME%/info.txt" (one description file per game)

"/home/user/roms/all.txt" (one description file for all games)

===== descriptionParserFile =====
Most rom collections that use game description files will have a different file format. RCB uses a configurable parser that reads parse instructions from an xml file and tries to parse the game descriptions with these instructions. There can only be one description parser file per `RomCollection` entry. The format of the parser file is explained in section [Preview#parserConfig.xml parserConfig.xml].

Note: normally you don't have to create the parser config on your own. You can use the available example files and create game descriptions based on these examples.

===== descFilePerGame =====
There can be one big description file with descriptions for all games in it. Or you can have one description file per game. 

In the first case (descFilePerGame=False) you must be sure that the game name in the description file matches exactly the name of your rom file (without disk prefix and extension) or that the crc value of the rom file matches the crc value inside the description file. See next section "Find game in description file" for more information.

In second case (descFilePerGame=True) the gamename must be somewhere in the path of the property `descFilePath` (configuration of descFilePath should look like this: "/home/user/emu/Amiga/Collection V1/%GAME%/info.txt" or this: "/home/user/emu/Amiga/Collection V1/info/%GAME%.txt").

default value: False


=== Find game in description file ===
If you use descFilePerGame=False (default) you have to take care that RCB can find the currently imported game in your description file. This can be done via romname = gamename or via crc matching.

==== Rom Collection ====
===== searchGameByCRC =====
Set this option to "True" if you would like to search games in your description file by crc value. It needs some time to compute crc values for large rom files. You should set this option to "False" if you have large rom files (PS1 for example) and you don't use crc values in your description files.

default value: True

===== searchGameByCRCIgnoreRomName =====
If you have games with the same rom filename but different crcs (and different gamename inside your description file) you should set this option to "True". This will skip checking the rom file name.

default value: False

===== useFoldernameAsCRC (new in 0.6.0) =====
Compare the crc in the description file with the foldername of the current rom file.

default value: False

===== useFilenameAsCRC (new in 0.6.0) =====
Compare the crc in the description file with the filename (without extension) of the current rom file.

default value: False

=== Misc import properties ===
==== Rom Collection ====
===== allowUpdate =====
If set to "False" RCB won't update your already imported game descriptions. All additional files (e.g. screenshots) will be imported if not already in database.

default value: True

===== ignoreOnScan =====
If set to "True" this `RomCollection` will be ignored completely during import. If you have all data for one `RomCollection` in database you can set this to "True" and there won't be any changes to this collection during the next imports.

default value: False

===== diskPrefix =====
This is used to detect multi rom games. RCB should not show every rom file in th UI if they all belong to the same game. Second reason to use this property are emulators that support loading more than one file at once (like uae). RCB can't rely on file numbering because you will also have different releases for one game (Lemmings, Lemmings 2, Lemmings 3).

Example:
If you use "`_Disk`" as diskPrefix and you have some rom files named "`Mygame.adf`", "`Mygame 2_Disk1.adf`" and "`Mygame 2_Disk2.adf`" this will be detected as two games "`Mygame`" and "`Mygame 2`" where "`Mygame 2`" consists of two rom files. In the UI you will see the "friendly" gamename "`Mygame 2`". If you have your emulatorCmd configured to support multiple rom files you can load both files at once.

default value: _Disk

===== maxFolderDepth (new_in_0.6.0) =====
Limit the number of subfolders RCB scans while searching for rom files. 

Default value: 999

== Browsing and displaying games ==
=== dynamic image placing ===
==== Rom Collection ====
===== fileTypeFor... =====
The fileTypeFor...-elements are used for dynamic image placing. With the fileTypeFor...-elements you can associate each of the available image controls in RCBs UI with a specific media type. If you configure multiple fileTypeFor...-elements of the same type they will be used as fallback: if there is no image or video of file type 1, it will try to load an image or video of file type 2. The file types must exactly match the value of `type` attribute that you used for `mediaPath` and `FileType` configuration.

In this example RCB will show your cover screenshots as background image in the main window:
{{{
<fileTypeForMainViewBackground>cover</fileTypeForMainViewBackground>
}}}

There are only two (alternating) controls in the main window (fileTypeForMainViewVideoWindowBig and fileTypeForMainViewVideoWindowSmall) and one control in the game details page (fileTypeForGameInfoViewVideoWindow) that are able to display video. If you use these fileTypeFor...-elements and a video is available for the selected game, the video playback is started automatically.

== Launching games ==
=== All systems ===
==== Rom Collection ====
===== emulatorCmd =====
The command that you specify as emulatorCmd will be invoked when you select a game. You can use the following placeholders in your commands:

%ROM% will be replaced with the current file name

%I% will be replaced with the zero-based index of the current rom file

If the emulator supports multiple rom files (like uae) you can use {} for repeating parameters. In a command like "uae {-%I% "%ROM%"}" the part in the {} brackets will be repeated for any disk file of the game. For example if you have an amiga game (`MyGame`) that consists of 2 disk files the uae command at runtime will be: 
{{{
uae -0 "`MyGame_Disk1.adf`" -1 "`MyGame_Disk2.adf`".
}}}

=== Xbox only ===
==== Rom Collection ====
===== xboxCreateShortcut (new in 0.6.0) =====
Creates a "temp.cut" file with the path to the emulator or the xbox game to be launched. This cut file will be launched instead of directly launching the emulator or xbox game.

default value: False

===== xboxCreateShortcutAddRomfile (new in 0.6.0) =====
Adds the rom filename as additional parameter to the cut file (not all emulators support this).

default value: False

===== xboxCreateShortcutUseShortGamename (new in 0.6.0) =====
This will use a short game name instead of complete file name (required for some exotic emulators).

default value: False


== config.xml reference ==

= Advanced topics =

== Enable fullscreen browser (new with 0.6.0) ==
With version 0.6.0 there is a new option to play videos in fullscreen mode. RCB creates a video playlist with every game in your current filter selection and starts playback in fullscreen. You can zap through the videos of this playlist and use the builtin Info Overlay with title, thumbnail and duration. RCB uses standard XBMC playlist and fullscreen player so there are not more options to interact with the playback from RCB.

To enable fullscreen video you have to add this line to every RomCollection in your config.xml (replace gameplay with your own video file type):
{{{
<fileTypeForMainViewFullscreenVideo>gameplay</fileTypeForMainViewFullscreenVideo>
}}}

"Import Settings" after you have done this.

Now you should see a button "Play Video Fullscreen" below the screenshots in Info and Info2 view.

=== Enable zapping in fullscreen browser ===

You may have to make some changes to your keymap.xml to get the zapping feature (make sure that you have access to "SkipNext" and "SkipPrevious" in FullscreenVideo and FullscreenInfo):

Windows/Linux keyboard.xml:
{{{
<FullscreenVideo>
	<keyboard>
	 ...
	  <!--<period>StepForward</period>
	  <comma>StepBack</comma>-->
	  <period>SkipNext</period>
	  <comma>SkipPrevious</comma>
	  ...
	</keyboard>
</FullscreenVideo>
<FullscreenInfo>
    <keyboard>
      ...
      <!--<period>StepForward</period>-->
      ...
    </keyboard>
</FullscreenInfo>
}}}

Xbox keymap.xml
{{{
<FullscreenVideo>
    ...
    <gamepad>
      ...
      <dpadup>SkipNext</dpadup>
      <dpaddown>SkipPrevious</dpaddown>
	  ...
    </gamepad>
</FullscreenVideo>
}}}

== Skinning RCB (new with 0.6.0) ==
Most things in RCBs skin files should be self explanating to a skinner. There are two skin xml files: "script-Rom_Collection_Browser-main.xml" and "script-Rom_Collection_Browser-gameinfo.xml". They are made for a PAL resolution with Confluence in mind. If you have improvements to my Confluence skin or want to migrate RCB to other skins please feel free to contribute.

=== Accessing RCBs images and videos ===
One thing that could be special in this script is the "dynamic image placing". As this script does not scrape information from web sites but uses locally stored media files (atm) I can't rely on a defined set of media files. The user may have small collections with only one image per game or others may have complete sets with 6 or more images and maybe video files per game. I want the user to decide where to show which type of image. The skinner should decide how it is presented. I am afraid this approach is not really XBMCish...

Thats why you find several code lines like this in the skin xml:
{{{
<texture>$INFO[ListItem.Property(mainviewbackground)]</texture>
}}}

The user decides per config what image he wants to use as background image. The skinner can get this file with the above code.

Here is a list of all available media controls:

images
{{{
mainviewbackground
gamelist
gamelistselected
mainviewgameinfobig
mainviewgameinfoupperleft
mainviewgameinfoupperright
mainviewgameinfolowerleft
mainviewgameinfolowerright
mainview1
mainview2
mainview3
}}}

videos
{{{
mainviewvideowindowbig
mainviewvideowindowsmall
}}}

Here you can see how this is done in the current skin: [Preview#dynamic_image_placing dynamic image placing]

=== Accessing RCBs text properties ===
It should also be possible to access all text properties in the skin.

The title of a game is available as ListItem.Label:
{{{
<label>$INFO[ListItem.Label]</label>
}}}

All other properties can be accessed like this:
{{{
<label>$INFO[ListItem.Property(console)]</label>
}}}

All available tags:
{{{
romcollection
console
year
plot
publisher
developer
reviewer
genre
maxplayers
rating
votes
url
region
media
perspective
controllertype
isfavorite
playcount
originaltitle
alternatetitle
translatedby
version
}}}

=== Special control ids ===
Some control ids are referenced inside the python code so you should not change them unless you know what you are doing.

==== Game lists ====
Lists always have ids 50-59 in XBMC. These lists are available as "view" in the UI. In RCB you also have to take care which views support video playback and one id is reserved for the game info dialog.

50-54:	views that support video

55-58:	views that don't support video

59:		game info dialog


==== Controls ====
Some controls that are available in all views should not be changed also.

===== Filter controls =====
Console:	500

Genre:		600

Year:		700

Publisher:	800

A-Z:		900


===== Scrollbars =====
For some reason I had trouble with handling scrollbars because they are sometimes present and sometimes not (depending on the length of text). If you use scrollbars in your view make sure they have ids 2200 or 2201. If you need more scrollbars just have a look at the beginning of the file gui.py. There is a list with scrollbar ids (CONROL_SCROLLBARS = (2200, 2201,)). You can add your id here and tell me that I should add it to the next RCB version.

===== Buttons =====
Import Settings:		3000

Import Games:			3100

Change View:			2

Play Video Fullscreen:	2900, 2901


If you add more than two views hat support fullscreen video you have to add the new ids to the python code: Go to gui.py and look for this line: CONTROL_BUTTON_VIDEOFULLSCREEN = (2900, 2901,)

===== Labels =====
Message label:	4000


== parserConfig.xml ==
The description file parser is very simple. It will read the parserConfig file that you specify in config.xml (you can have different parserConfigs for every `RomCollection`). This parserConfig xml file will be read element by element and transferred into parser grammar (using pyparsing). That means you have to take care of the elements order. Afterwards pyparsing reads the text file and tries to apply its given grammar. It always moves forward and looks for a match to the actual grammar token. If it does not match it will raise an exception. You will find this exception message in the log file "update.log" (RCB home directory).

This is an example game description text file:

Game: Airborne Ranger
Platform: Amiga
Region: 
Media: 
Controller: 
Genre: Action, Simulation
Release Year: 1989
Developer: MicroProse Software, Inc.
Publisher: MicroProse Software, Inc.
Players: ????
URL: http://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/airborne-ranger
Description:
In this action/simulation game by Microprose the player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases:
Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing.
Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself.
Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s
Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.).

Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.

}}}

The parser config for this text file will look like this:

{{{
<parserConfig>
	<GameGrammar type="multiline">
		<SkippableContent>Game: </SkippableContent>
		<Game restOfLine="true"></Game>		
		<SkippableContent>Platform: </SkippableContent>
		<Platform delimiter="," restOfLine="true"></Platform>
		<SkippableContent>Region: </SkippableContent>
		<Region delimiter="," restOfLine="true"></Region>
		<SkippableContent>Media: </SkippableContent>
		<Media delimiter="," restOfLine="true"></Media>
		<SkippableContent>Controller: </SkippableContent>
		<Controller delimiter="," restOfLine="true"></Controller>
		<SkippableContent>Genre: </SkippableContent>
		<Genre delimiter="," restOfLine="true"></Genre>
		<SkippableContent>Release Year: </SkippableContent>
		<ReleaseYear delimiter="," restOfLine="true"></ReleaseYear>
		<SkippableContent>Developer: </SkippableContent>

		<URL delimiter="," restOfLine="true"></URL>
		<SkippableContent restOfLine="true">Description:</SkippableContent>
		<Description skipTo="*"></Description>
		<SkippableContent restOfLine="true"></SkippableContent>		
	</GameGrammar>
</parserConfig>
}}}

Lets explain the first two lines of the config file:
`<SkippableContent>Game: </SkippableContent>` will search for the exact occurance of "Game: " at the beginning of the text file. If it is not found pyparsing will raise an exception and stops parsing. If the text is found it will skip this content and executes the next rule: `<Game restOfLine="true"></Game>`. This will take all text from the current position (we are one letter behind "Game: " now) to the end of the line and stores this as a value to the key `Game`. When parsing of the complete file is done RCB can access this value using the given key.

There are not many configuration options at the moment. Actually only `GameGrammar type="multiline`" is supported. I think about adding support for xml files or one-line csv but that has a low prio.

=== Elements ===
There are only two types of elements in the current version.

==== Named Element ====
A named element like `<Game restOfLine="true"></Game>` will return a key value pair to RCB where the element name is the key and the parsed content will be the value. All information in your description file that is valuable input to RCB must be declared as a named element in this configuration file.

Supported elements in current version:

Game, crc, Genre, ReleaseYear, Publisher, Description, Reviewer, Region, Media, Controller, Players, Developer, URL, Rating, Votes, Perspective, OriginalTitle, AlternateTitle, TranslatedBy, Version



==== Skippable Content ====
As the name says all content that matches the given instruction will be skipped. `SkippableContent` may have an element value. This value must occur exactly at the current position in the description file.


=== Attributes ===
==== restOfLine ====
If "true" all content from current position to the rest of the line will be matched by this expression

==== delimiter ====
If you have delimited values this will specify the used delimiter. Every delimited value will be saved to database as a single entry.

NOTE: Actually only the "," will be recognized as a delimiter.

==== skipTo ====
If you have multiline values (like description in the above example) you can specify a token that must occur after the multiline value. This token must be unique enough to not occur in your multiline value. The `*` in the above example may be a bad choice as there is a good chance of a star to occur in a game description.

==== optional ====
If set to "true" the parser will raise no error if it can't find the current token.

=== Special values ===
==== Line Start ====
If you use `LineStart` as an element value the parser will search for the given token at the beginning of a line. The following example will search for a line that starts with a "`*`":
{{{
<SkippableContent skipTo="LineStart*"></SkippableContent>
}}}

==== Line End ====
If you use `LineEnd` as an element or attribute value the parser will search for the given token at the end of a line. The following example will search for a line that ends with a "`*`":
{{{
<SkippableContent skipTo="*LineEnd"></SkippableContent>
}}}

You can use `LineStart` and `LineEnd` together. The following example will search for a line that contains only a "`*`":
{{{
<SkippableContent skipTo="LineStart*LineEnd"></SkippableContent>
}}}


= Update an older installation =
== without preserving configuration changes ==
If you just played around with the test scenario and did not make any relevant changes to "config.xml" or the parser configuration you can just delete the complete RCB folder and follow the steps in the chapter "Installation" or "Setup test scenario".

== preserving configuration changes ==
Since V0.4 it should be possible to keep your old database. Changes to data structure will be done automatically. Please backup your database before trying this. I tested a lot but who knows...


=== 0.6.1 - 0.7.3 -> 0.7.4 ===
If you want to keep your old database and your old config.xml you have to do the following steps:
  
  * Make sure your old database `MyGames.db` is still available in your RCB userdata folder. RCB needs your old database to perform the update.
  * Launch RCB: This will automatically update your database and config.xml to the new structure. RCB will make backups of your old files.
  * After this first launch you should already be able to browse all your games
  * Before you can launch roms you have to make one change to your config.xml manually: The property "emulatorCmd" has been split up in two properties: "emulatorCmd" and "emulatorParams". Move the params from "emulatorCmd" to "emulatorParams" and you should be done with the update.


=== V0.5/0.5.x -> 0.6.0 ===
If you want to keep your old database and your old config.xml you have to do the following steps:

  * V0.5 only: Backup your database (just copy the file `MyGames.db` from RCB database folder somewhere outside the RCB path)
  * Backup your `config.xml`
  * Delete the folder "Rom Collection Browser" (V0.5) or "script.games.rom.collection.browser" (0.5.x)
  * Follow the steps in chapter "Installation"
  * Copy `MyGames.db` and `config.xml` to your userdata folder (Dharma: addon_data, Camelot: script_data) to "script.games.rom.collection.browser"
  * Check if you need one of the following new properties in your `config.xml` (RCB will run without them):
    * RomCollection
      * [Preview#xboxCreateShortcut_(new_in_0.6.0) xboxCreateShortcut]	  	  
      * [Preview#xboxCreateShortcutAddRomfile_(new_in_0.6.0) xboxCreateShortcutAddRomfile]
      * [Preview#xboxCreateShortcutUseShortGamename_(new_in_0.6.0) xboxCreateShortcutUseShortGamename]
      * [Preview#useFoldernameAsCRC_(new_in_0.6.0) useFoldernameAsCRC]
      * [Preview#useFilenameAsCRC_(new_in_0.6.0) useFilenameAsCRC]
      * [Preview#maxFolderDepth_(new_in_0.6.0) maxFolderDepth]
    * RCBSetting
      * [Preview#logLevel_(new_in_0.6.0) logLevel]
      * [Preview#showEntryAllChars_(new_in_0.6.0) showEntryAllChars]
      * [Preview#preventUnfilteredSearch_(new_in_0.6.0) preventUnfilteredSearch]
  * When you start RCB it will ask you to import settings: Say "yes".



=== V0.4 -> V0.5 ===
If you want to keep your old database and your old config.xml you have to do the following steps:

  * Backup your database (just copy the file `MyGames.db` from RCB database folder somewhere outside the RCB path)
  * Backup your `config.xml`
  * Delete the folder "Rom Collection Browser"
  * Download "Rom Collection Browser V0.5.zip (http://romcollectionbrowser.googlecode.com/files/Rom%20Collection%20Browser%20V0.5.zip)
  * Unzip it to your XBMC scripts folder
  * Copy `MyGames.db` and `config.xml` back to the database folder of your new RCB
  * Make the following changes to your `config.xml`:
  
 Add `FileType`-elements:
 You have to add one `FileType`-element for every different image- or video- type in your old config-file. If you had an `<imgPath type="cover">` in your old config you need to add a `FileType` cover in your new config.
 {{{
	<FileTypes>
		<FileType>
			<name>cover</name>
			<type>image</type>
			<parent>game</parent>
		</FileType>
		<FileType>
			<name>screenshotingame</name>
			<type>image</type>
			<parent>game</parent>
		</FileType>
		...
	</FileTypes>
 }}}

 Rename all imgPath- and videoPath-elements to mediaPath:
 {{{
	# old:
	<imgPath type="cover">PathToTestData/Collection V1/cover/%GAME%.jpg</imgPath>
	<videoPath type="gameplay">PathToTestData/Collection V3/Movies/%GAME%.wmv</videoPath>
	
	# new:
	<mediaPath type="cover">PathToTestData/Collection V1/cover/%GAME%.jpg</mediaPath>
	<mediaPath type="gameplay">PathToTestData/Collection V3/Movies/%GAME%.wmv</mediaPath>
 }}}
 
 
 Add new configuration options to all `RomCollections`:
 {{{
	<searchGameByCRC>True</searchGameByCRC>
	<searchGameByCRCIgnoreRomName>False</searchGameByCRCIgnoreRomName>
	<ignoreGameWithoutDesc>False</ignoreGameWithoutDesc>
 }}}
 
 Rename `fileTypeForMainViewGameInfo` to `fileTypeForMainViewGameInfoBig`
 {{{
	# old:
	<fileTypeForMainViewGameInfo>screenshotingame</fileTypeForMainViewGameInfo>
	
	# new:
	<fileTypeForMainViewGameInfoBig>screenshotingame</fileTypeForMainViewGameInfoBig>
 }}}
 
  
 optional:
 
 Add new Image Placing options:
   * fileTypeForGameListSelected
   * fileTypeForMainViewBackground
   * fileTypeForMainViewGameInfoUpperLeft
   * fileTypeForMainViewGameInfoUpperRight
   * fileTypeForMainViewGameInfoLowerLeft
   * fileTypeForMainViewGameInfoLowerRight
   * fileTypeForMainViewVideoWindowSmall
   * fileTypeForMainView1
   * fileTypeForMainView2
   * fileTypeForMainView3
 

=== V0.3 -> V0.4 ===
If you want to keep your old database and your old config.xml you have to do the following steps:

  * Backup your database (just copy the file `MyGames.db` from RCB database folder somewhere outside the RCB path)
  * Backup your `config.xml`
  * Delete the folder "Rom Collection Browser"
  * Download "Rom Collection Browser V0.4.zip (http://romcollectionbrowser.googlecode.com/files/Rom%20Collection%20Browser%20V0.4.zip)
  * Unzip it to your XBMC scripts folder
  * Copy `MyGames.db` and `config.xml` back to the database folder of your new RCB
  * Make the following changes to your `config.xml`:


Rename all of these elements:
{{{
			<coverPath>your path here</coverPath>
			<ingamescreenshotPath>your path here</ingamescreenshotPath>
			<titleScreenshotPath>your path here</titleScreenshotPath>
			<cartridgePath>your path here</cartridgePath>
			<ingamevidPath>your path here</ingamevidPath>
			<trailerPath>your path here</trailerPath>
}}}

to this new structure (the logic behind this should be self explanating...):
{{{
			<imgPath type="cover">your path here</imgPath>
			<imgPath type="screenshotingame">your path here</imgPath>
			<imgPath type="screenshottitle">your path here</imgPath>
			<imgPath type="cartridge">your path here</imgPath>
			<videoPath type="gameplay">your path here</videoPath>
			<videoPath type="trailer">your path here</videoPath>
}}}

Add new elements to all `<RomCollection>` elements:
{{{
			<fileTypeForGameList>cover</fileTypeForGameList>
			<fileTypeForMainViewGameInfo>screenshotingame</fileTypeForMainViewGameInfo>
			<fileTypeForGameInfoViewBackground>cover</fileTypeForGameInfoViewBackground>

  * Launch RCB: You should see your old data but without any images
  * Click `Import Settings`: Now you should see your images again.


= Changelog =
== 0.7.4 ==

  * scraping various online sources (thevideogamedb.com, thegamesdb.net, giantbomb.com, mobygames.com) for game info and artwork
  
=== Configuration ===  
  * rework configuration
        * don't import settings to database: all settings are read at startup from config.xml

        * refactoring of config.xml
	* automatic update of existing database and config.xml to the new structure    
    * bugfix: launch emulators with whitespaces in path

== 0.6.0 ==
=== UI and general behaviour ===
  * fullscreen video browser
  * implemented different caching options: CACHEALL, CACHEITEM, CACHEITEMANDNEXT

  * skinning support: all game properties are available in the skin xml now
  * delay videoplayback for one second: better behaviour when browsing the game list
  * added log level as parameter to config.xml
  * new option: preventUnfilteredSearch (unfiltered searches may cause problems with large rom collections)
  * commented config file
  * changed ordering in game list to case insensitive
  * support for pgup, pgdn, home, end
  * bugfix: don't restart video if we are playing the same file (while moving around but not changing selected game)


=== Import ===
  * restructuring of import methods: scan large description files per game (previous version scanned the complete file at once causing out of memory errors on xbox)
  * changed behavior of progress dialog when importing games: progress update per game and not per rom collection
  * use default values for all settings: may keep config.xml more simple
  * check config.xml modification time at startup
  * new option: using foldername as crc value (useFoldernameAsCRC)
  * new option: using filename as crc value (useFilenameAsCRC)
  * ignore case when searching for media files (works also on linux)
  * limit number of subdirs when importing roms
  * bugfix: non-ascii chars in filenames during import
  * bugfix: unique constraint on game (name, romcollection)
  * bugfix: handle crc with leading zero
  * bugfix: handle game names with brackets []

== 0.5.3 ==
  * Dharma compatibility (installable via addon browser, slight code modifications with no impact to the end user)
  * changed the versioning scheme from Vx.y to x.y.z (this was needed to get this script submitted to the repo - and it is the better versioning scheme:))
  * no more writing to the scripts directory: all files will be written to userdata/addon_data/script.games.rom.collection.browser. The file config.xml is still read from RCBs database directory. It will be backed up to the userdata directory after every "Import Settings" because XBMC will delete the complete RCB addon directory in case of an update.

  * display console name of selected game
=== Game Import ===
  * import images for developer, publisher, console or rom collection
  * find game in description file by crc value
  * check crc value of files inside a zip archive (1 file per archive only)
  * import roms in sub folders
  * more robust game description parser
  * check config.xml for common errors before importing
  * different log levels
 
  

== V0.4 ==
  * new game info view: pressing info button when a game is selected will open a new window with additional game information
  * showing video in game info view
  * dynamic image placing: RCB has 8 different controls to show images. The image type (screenshot, cover, ...) can be configured for every control.
  * dynamic image types: there won't be fix image categories anymore. You can define your own image types (e.g. ingame screenshots, title screenshots, highscore screenshots, ...) and use this categories to configure image placing. Actually you could use 8 different image types or 7 image types and 1 video type (video window overlays one of the image controls).
