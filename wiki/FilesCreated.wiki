You will find RCBs configuration files in your XBMC userdata folder ([http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Special_protocol#Platform_Specific_Default_Mappings Look here for special://home]). Inside your userdata folder you will find RCBs config files in "script_data" (Camelot / Xbox) or "addon_data" (Dharma / Eden) in the sub folder "script.games.rom.collection.browser". If you want to know what happens behind the scenes or directly want to edit the main config file instead of using the configuration dialogs, have a look at the file "config.xml". All game relevant data is stored in RCBs database "`MyGames.db`". You can view or even edit the database with any SQLite database editor. It is a good idea to backup these files before you plan to make bigger changes. You will also find some scrapeResult-files that show you what information was missed during your last game import.
