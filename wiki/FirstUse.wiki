  * Start XBMC and launch RCB
  * If there is no file config.xml in your userdata folder, RCB will start a simple creation wizard. This will help you to create a config file with most common settings.  
  * See section [BasicConfiguration Basic Configuration] for more information.
  * In most scenarios the wizard will fit all your needs. More advanced or special settings still must be done in the config file itself. See section Complete config.xml Reference for more information.
  
== XBMC Live users ==
If you use XBMC Live without an additional window manager you can use RCB only in non-solo mode. See section [AddonSettings#Use_Emulator_solo Use Emulator solo] for details.

== Xbox users ==
Launching games on Xbox differs from launching games on a PC. You can launch .xbe-files directly from RCB if you set "%ROM%" as emulatorCmd and leave emulatorParams empty. If you want to launch an emulator and pass the rom file as an argument to the emu you have to use .cut-files. RCB can create this .cut-files on-the-fly for you. With using .cut-files you also have to set emulatorCmd to "%ROM%".

See [LaunchingGames Launching games] for details.
