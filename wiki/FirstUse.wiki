  * Start XBMC and launch RCB
  * If there is no file config.xml in your userdata folder, RCB will start a simple creation wizard. This will help you to create a config file with most common settings.  
  * See section [BasicConfiguration Basic Configuration] for more information.
  * After the wizard is completed RCB will ask you to import your games. It shows a simple options dialog to select most basic scraping settings. See section HowScrapingWorks for more information.
  
In most scenarios the config wizard will fit all your needs. More advanced or special settings still must be done in the config file itself. See section [ConfigXmlReference Complete config.xml Reference] for more information.

If you use XBMC Live without an additional window manager you can use RCB only in non-solo mode. See section [AddonSettings#Use_Emulator_solo Use Emulator solo] for details.
