= First use =
  * On first launch RCB will start a simple configuration wizard. This will help you to create a config file with most common settings. See section [ConfigurationWizard Configuration Wizard] for more information.
  * After the wizard is completed RCB will ask you to import your games. It shows a simple options dialog to select most basic scraping settings. See section [ImportGames Import Games] for more information.
  
In most scenarios the config wizard will fit all your needs. More advanced or special settings can be adjusted in the [EditRomCollection Edit Rom Collection] dialog or [AddoSettings Addon settings].
