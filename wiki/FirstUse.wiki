  * Start XBMC and launch RCB
  * If there is no file config.xml in your userdata folder, RCB will start a simple configuration wizard. This will help you to create a config file with most common settings.  
  * See section [ConfigurationWizard Configuration Wizard] for more information.
  * After the wizard is completed RCB will ask you to import your games. It shows a simple options dialog to select most basic scraping settings. See section [ImportGames Import Games] for more information.
