  * Start XBMC and launch RCB
  * If there is no file config.xml in your userdata folder, RCB will start a simple creation wizard. This will help you to create a config file with most common settings.  
  * See section [Create_a_config_file_with_startup_wizard Create a config file with startup wizard] for more information.
  * In most scenarios the wizard will fit all your needs. More advanced or special settings still must be done in the config file itself. See [ConfigXmlReference Complete config.xml Reference] for more information.
  
== XBMC Live users ==
If you use XBMC Live without an additional window manager you can use RCB only in non-solo mode. See section [Use_Emulator_solo Use Emulator solo] for details.

== Xbox users ==
Launching games on Xbox differs from launching games on a PC. You can launch .xbe-files directly from RCB if you set "%ROM%" as emulatorCmd and leave emulatorParams empty. If you want to launch an emulator and pass the rom file as an argument to the emu you have to use .cut-files. RCB can create this .cut-files on-the-fly for you. With using .cut-files you also have to set emulatorCmd to "%ROM%".

See [ConfigXmlReference#Launching_games Launching games] for details.
