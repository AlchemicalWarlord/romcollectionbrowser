= First use =
  * On first launch RCB will start a simple configuration wizard. This will help you to create a config file with most common settings. See section [ConfigurationWizard Configuration Wizard] for more information.
  * After the wizard is completed RCB will ask you to import your games. It shows a simple options dialog to select most basic scraping settings. See section [ImportGames Import Games] for more information.
  
In most scenarios the config wizard will fit all your needs. More advanced or special settings can be adjusted in the [EditRomCollection Edit Rom Collection] dialog or [AddonSettings Addon settings].

If the wizard does not start or you canceled it before completion you can launch the wizard again via context menu. Just enter RCB and press "C" on the keyboard or "Menu" on the remote. Select "Add Rom Collection" from the context menu to start the configuration wizard again.

= XBMC Live users =
If you use XBMC Live without an additional window manager you can use RCB only in non-solo mode. See section [EditRomCollectionLaunchGames#Use_emulator_in_solo_mode Use Emulator solo] for details.
