#summary to RCBs wiki

With this XBMC script you can browse and launch emulator roms and standalone games (Windows, Linux and Xbox). It will scrape game info and artwork from various online sources or imports local available game descriptions, images and videos. RCB will parse simple text files with additional game information like genre, publisher, developer, release year, etc. To support different description file formats and scrapable web sites you can configure the behaviour of the parser with xml configuration files.

Before you can launch games with RCB you have to download, install and configure one or more emulators. Find out how to launch your emulator via command line. You will need this information to launch the emulator with RCB.

Check out the following pages if you have trouble with setting up the script or want to know how to enable more advanced features.
