With this XBMC script you can browse and launch emulator roms and standalone games (Windows, Linux, Mac and Xbox). It will scrape game info and artwork from various online sources or imports local available game descriptions, images and videos. RCB can also parse simple text and xml files with additional game information like genre, publisher, developer, release year, etc.

Before you can launch games with RCB you have to download, install and configure one or more emulators. Find out how to launch your emulator via command line. You will need this information to launch the emulator with RCB.

Have a look at the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xvGM8eHWB0 Youtube video] to see how RCB is used and looks like.
