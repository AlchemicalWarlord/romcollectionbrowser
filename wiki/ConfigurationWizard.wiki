On first run when there is no config file available RCB will ask you to create a config file with the wizard. You can also launch the wizard anytime from context menu to add new Rom Collections.

First you have to choose a scenario: Online scraping or local data. In online scraping scenario RCB will scrape different web sites for game infos and artwork. In local data scenario you have to tell RCB where to find artwork, videos and game descriptions on your system. You can also mix both scenarios and use your local available artwork but scrape game information online. In this case you should choose the second option.

= Online scraping scenario =

  * Choose a platform. If you don't find your platform in the list, select "Other" and type the name of your platform. Note: Some scrapers won't work properly without a known platform.

  * Enter one or more file masks (comma-separated). RCB will search the rom path and all sub folders for files that match the given filemask.

  * Select the path where you want to store your artwork (or where your artwork is already stored). This folder can be empty, RCB will create the needed sub folders on its own. It is a good idea to have platform specific artwork folders as there are a lot of games available on different platforms and that have platform specific artwork files. Note: RCB scrapes and downloads several different artwork types. It needs to store all these files in different folders, so it creates sub folders below the given path: boxfront, boxback, cartridge, screenshot and fanart for all non-MAME systems and boxfront, action, title, cabinet and marquee for MAME-systems. If you want to add your own artwork to RCB in online scraping scenario, make sure that your artwork is placed in the correct sub folders. The user that runs xbmc needs write access to these folders. The downloaded files will be named like the rom file with the extension of the downloaded image file.

= Local data scenario =

The first steps of this wizard are equal to the online scraping scenario. You have to choose a system, path to your emulator and rom files. After this is done there will be some local data specific configuration steps.

  * Choose an artwork type.

  * Choose the type of description files. There may be large files with descriptions for all of your games or single description files that only contain description for one game. If you just want to use your local artwork and scrape game info online, select "Scrape game info online".

= Find your configuration files =
There is one main configuration file "config.xml" that must be placed in your userdata folder ([http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Special_protocol#Platform_Specific_Default_Mappings Look here for special://home]). Inside your userdata folder you will find RCBs config files in  "script_data" (Camelot) or "addon_data" (Dharma) in the sub folder "script.games.rom.collection.browser".
