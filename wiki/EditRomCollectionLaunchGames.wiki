new with 0.8.6

= Rom Collection =
With the Rom Collection selector you can select which Rom Collection you want to edit. All controls in the dialog will be updated with the data of the selected Rom Collection.

= Emulator Cmd =
The command that you specify as "Emulator cmd" will be invoked when you select a game. In this dialog you can directly navigate to the executable.

= Emulator Params =
The params that are passed to the emulator. You can use the following placeholders in your commands:

%ROM% - will be replaced with the current file name (complete path)

%ROMFILE% - will be replaced with the rom filename without path (MyGame.smc)

%ROMNAME% - will be replaced with the rom filename without path and extension (MyGame)

%GAME% - will be replaced with the name of the game that you see while browsing games in RCB (e.g. My Game)

%ASKNUM% - select numbers from 0-9 (specially build for zsnes savestate handling but may be useful in other scenarios - who knows)

%ASKTEXT% - will launch the XBMC keyboard and then replaced with the text that you enter (useful for playing around with special settings like selecting graphic or sound drivers etc. - just edit the game command on every single game launch)

%I% - will be replaced with the zero-based index of the current rom file (in multi rom scenario). 

If the emulator supports multiple rom files (like uae) you can use {} for repeating parameters. In a command like "uae {-%I% "%ROM%"}" the part in the {} brackets will be repeated for any disk file of the game. For example if you have an amiga game (`MyGame`) that consists of 2 disk files the uae command at runtime will be: 
{{{
uae -0 "MyGame_Disk1.adf" -1 "MyGame_Disk2.adf".
}}}

= Use emulator in solo mode =
If set to "True" RCB will try to quit XBMC before starting the emulator. After exiting the emulator you will return to XBMC. If set to "False" the emulator will be launched while XBMC is running in the background.

This mechanism invokes a batch (Windows) or bash (Linux) file. Linux only: make sure the file "RCB install dir/applaunch.sh" is executable. If you have problems with launching the emulator or returning to XBMC please check the commands in the file "applaunch.bat" (Windows) or "applaunch.sh" (Linux). You must be able to execute the command that is used to launch XBMC on a command line.

When restarting XBMC RCB will try to create a file "autoexec.py" in XBMCs main script directory (Camelot) or in your userdata folder (Dharma). This will be used by XBMC to launch RCB automatically after restarting. If you already use an "autoexec.py" RCB will try to backup your original file and restores it after restarting. Make sure that the user that runs XBMC has write access to XBMCs main script directory (Camelot only).

= Do not extract zip files =
If RCB detects zip or 7z-files while launching games, it will by default extract these files and offer a selection of all available roms inside the compressed file. Some emulators support or require to get the compressed file unextracted (like MAME). In this case just set "Do not extract zip files" to "True".

= Savestate path =
The path to the savestate files of the selected Rom Collection. See [LaunchingSavestates Launching savestates] for more information on how to configure launching savestates.

= Savestate file mask =
The file mask that will be used to search for the savestate files of the launched game in the savestate directory.

You can use all placeholders in savestate file mask that are available in emulator params.

= Savestate params =
The parameters that will be passed to the emulator when launching savestates.

You can use all placeholders in savestate file mask that are available in emulator params. Additionally you can use %STATEFILE% for the complete path to the statefile.
