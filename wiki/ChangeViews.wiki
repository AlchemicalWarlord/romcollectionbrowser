#sidebar SideBar

All available skins for RCB support different views of your Rom Collection. Like all other lists in XBMC you can switch between Thumb views, Info views and many other. In RCB the "Change View" button is placed in the bottom panel that is hidden by default. You can access it from horizontal game lists with the DOWN button, from vertical game lists with the RIGHT button.
