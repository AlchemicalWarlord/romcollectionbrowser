In online scraping scenario game description will be added automatically (if available). If you want to use local game descriptions you will need description files (containing the description) and a parser configuration (tells RCB how to parse the description file format). The format of the parser configuration is explained in section [CreatingYourOwnDescriptionParser Creating your own description parser].

You can download some (nearly) complete description files and a working parserConfig here: http://romcollectionbrowser.googlecode.com/files/gamedesc.zip. Actually it covers "NES", "SNES", "SEGA 32", "SEGA CD", "SEGA Genesis", "SEGA Game Gear", "SEGA Master System", "SEGA SG-1000" and "Gameboy". These descriptions all contain crc values, so you should not need to rename your roms to match the descriptions.

User [http://forum.xbmc.org/showpost.php?p=612640&postcount=580 spyvsspy has compiled] some more game descriptions (all included with working parserConfig and all using crc values): [http://jumbofiles.com/4bo7ue9f000b Mame], [http://jumbofiles.com/s6i1kve2n18t C64], [http://jumbofiles.com/kmcvpukjayn2 Amiga small], [http://jumbofiles.com/1ija5cepffeh Amiga big (may be problematic to parse because of its size)], [http://jumbofiles.com/ro4bfpiajjp5 ColecoVision]

Local game description and parsers are also added as scrapers. See section [ImportGamesAndMedia#Add_game_descriptions Add game descriptions] for more details.
